In terms of visualization, a RasterMap class is provided, which can quickly generate corresponding raster maps based on the provided matrix according to the following rules:        

    a) 0 represents a regular grid     
    b) 1 represents the starting grid     
    c) 2 represents the final grid     
    d) 3 represents obstacle grid     
    
In addition, a user interface program written using MVC architecture is provided to visualize the running process of the algorithm.    
In terms of algorithms, A * and Dijkstra algorithms have been implemented based on the Point and PointGroup classes defined in the rastermap module. You can directly use this interface to find the shortest path.

1. Clone it onto your computer.
```
git clone git@github.com:YuanshengShe/shortestpathTK.git
```
2. Run the main. py file placed in the interface directory.
