In terms of visualization, a RasterMap class is provided, which can quickly generate corresponding raster maps based on the provided matrix according to the following rules:        

    a) 0 represents a regular grid     
    b) 1 represents the starting grid     
    c) 2 represents the final grid     
    d) 3 represents obstacle grid     
    
In addition, a user interface program written using MVC architecture is provided to visualize the running process of the algorithm.    
In terms of algorithms, A * and Dijkstra algorithms have been implemented based on the Point and PointGroup classes defined in the rastermap module. You can directly use this interface to find the shortest path.

<font color='blue'>About how to use</font>：
1. Clone it onto your computer.
```
git clone git@github.com:YuanshengShe/shortestpathTK.git
```
2. Run the main. py file placed in the interface directory.
